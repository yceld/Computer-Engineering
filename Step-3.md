# Steps 3 and 4: Evaluating Alternatives + Engineering Decision 

## 1. Justify your choice based on simplicity, safety, and reliability. 

Similarly to the real world example, both logic 1 and logic 2 checks the train sensor if an oncoming train is coming, then the gate is lowered, with the added condition that if a vehicle is on the tracks, the gate is lowered. 

Logic 2 will be chosen over Logic 1 

**- Simplicity:** Logic 2 is simpler as it has one less line of logic 

**- Safety:** Both are fail-safe for the given inputs, but logic 2â€™s simplicity makes it safer. 

**- Reliability:** A simpler system with less logical steps is more reliable
