## Step 2: Exploring Alternatives 

**1. Brainstorm at least two different logic-based solutions.**

Logic 1.  

IF train sensor is on, lower gate 

IF vehicle sensor is on, lower gate 

ELSE raise gate 

The system checks if train is coming, and lowers the gate if it is. The system then checks if a vehicle is on the track, and lowers the gate if it is. If neither is true, then the gate is raised. 

Logic 2. 

IF train sensor OR vehicle sensor is on, lower gate 

ELSE raise gate 

The system checks if either a train is coming or a vehicle is on the tracks, and lowers the gate if it is. If it’s not, then the gate is raised. 

**2. Research at least one real-world example of a crossing gate control system. Please be brief (100 words).**

A real-world example of a crossing gate control system involves a track circuit. The rails are used to form an electrical circuit. A low-voltage current is passed between the rails through a relay at one end. When a train’s axles enter this circuit, they short the current, causing the relay to drop. The change in the relay’s state indicates that a train is occupying the circuit, meaning that an oncoming train is on the tracks. The system uses a calculate time to predict the train’s arrival at the crossing and activates the gates with enough warning time.[1]
