# Step 1: Exploring the Problem 

## 1. Restate the problem in your own words. 
The task is to design a safety system that automatically controls railway crossing gates. The goal is to prevent accidents by ensuring the gates are down whenever a train is near, or a vehicle is on the tracks and only raising them when all clear conditions are met. 

## 2. Identify and describe all inputs and outputs of the system. 

**Inputs**

  - Train Sensor: senses if train is coming 

  - Vehicle Sensor: senses if vehicle is on the tracks 

**Outputs**

  - Gate 

## 3. Describe the context, constraints (technical, economic, social, environmental, legal), and stakeholders you can think about. 

**- Context:** A public railway level crossing where road and rail traffic intersect 

**- Constraints:**

  - Technical: Must use simple reliable logic 

  - Economic: Must be cost effective 

  - Social: Must be safe for the public 

  - Environmental: Must operate during various weather conditions 

  - Legal: Mut comply with safety standards and regulations 

**- Stakeholders:** Train driver, train passengers, train crew, railway company, residents, government.
